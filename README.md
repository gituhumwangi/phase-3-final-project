## Recipe Management System using SQLAlchemy

This is a Python-based Recipe Management System built using SQLAlchemy, a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library. The system allows you to define and manage recipes, ingredients, and user reviews. It provides a structured way to store and retrieve information about recipes, their ingredients, and user feedback.

## The Recipe Management System consists of three main entities:

Recipe: Represents a recipe with various attributes such as title, description, instructions, cooking time, and more.

Ingredient: Represents an ingredient used in a recipe. Ingredients are associated with a specific recipe.

Review: Represents user reviews of recipes, including comments and ratings.

To use this system, you can:

Create, read, update, and delete recipes, ingredients, and reviews programmatically using Python code.

Interact with the database through SQLAlchemy's ORM capabilities.

Customize and extend the system as per your requirements by modifying the provided SQLAlchemy models.

Code Structure
main.py: Contains the SQLAlchemy models for Recipe, Ingredient, and Review. It also includes the database schema and relationships between these entities.

README.md: This documentation file explaining the code and how to use it.

Example Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use this Recipe Management System:

python
Copy code
# Import the necessary modules
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

# Create a SQLAlchemy engine and session
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///recipes.db')
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Create a new recipe
new_recipe = Recipe(
    title="Spaghetti Carbonara",
    description="A classic Italian pasta dish",
    instructions="Cook pasta, mix with eggs, cheese, and pancetta",
    cooking_time=datetime.datetime(0, 0, 0, 0, 30),  # Replace with actual time
    number_of_servings=2
)

# Add ingredients to the recipe
ingredient1 = Ingredient(title="Pasta", quantity_measure="200g")
ingredient2 = Ingredient(title="Eggs", quantity_measure="2")
new_recipe.ingredients = [ingredient1, ingredient2]

# Add a review
new_review = Review(
    comments="Delicious! My family loved it.",
    rating=5
)
new_recipe.reviews = [new_review]

# Add the new recipe to the database
session.add(new_recipe)
session.commit()

# Retrieve a recipe by title
retrieved_recipe = session.query(Recipe).filter_by(title="Spaghetti Carbonara").first()

# Print recipe details
print(retrieved_recipe)

# Close the session and database connection
session.close()
This example demonstrates how to create a new recipe, add ingredients and reviews, and retrieve recipe details from the database.
